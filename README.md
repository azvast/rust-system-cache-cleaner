# cache_cleaner
This is a small rust program to clear cache files on my system. This is ment only as a tool for
me to learn rust and automate my systems deleting of cache.

Though if you still want to use it procced at your own risk.
Right now everything is hard coded to /home/dakota/*, So it will do nothing.

Depends:
    I'm building this against rust 1.22.1.

to build:
    git clone https://github.com/BearzRobotics/cache_cleaner.git
    cd cache_cleaner
    cargo build
