Today Were going to start talking about ownership. I thought 
that going over an actuall project would be more benefical 
than some random snipt To follow along clone my repo from github.

git clone https://github.com/BearzRobotics/cache_cleaner.git

Ownership rules:
    Each value in Rust has a variable thatâ€™s called its owner.
    There can only be one owner at a time.
    When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
